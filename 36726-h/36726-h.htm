<h2>CALLED TO THE COLORS</h2>

<p>This is the story of a "tenderfoot"&mdash;of a
pink-cheeked, petted lad, and of his
first service as a Boy Scout.</p>

<p>Danny Harding was what his mother's
friends termed "wonderfully fortunate," but
Danny himself took quite another view of
his life's circumstances as he hurried home
from school one afternoon, an hour before
the regular time for dismissal.</p>

<p>The day was golden with sunshine, but the
boy's spirit was dark. There was singing in
the air and singing in the tree tops, but in
the heart which pounded against his immaculate
jacket were silent rage and despair.</p>

<p>The Whippoorwill Patrol had been called
to the colors, and he the untried, the untested
tenderfoot would have to remain at
home in luxurious security, while the huskier,
browner, less-sheltered lads answered their
country's call. It was beyond the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
a boy's heart to endure&mdash;the mortification&mdash;the
wild despair of it! They would call him
a slacker, a <i>coward</i>! But, worse still, his
country needed him, and he could not answer!</p>

<p>Danny brushed away the tears which
threatened to blind him, and stumbled on.</p>

<p>The call had come through a telegram
from the Scout Master to the boys while
they were yet at school, and the teacher had
promptly dismissed them to service. The
Whippoorwills were to leave immediately
upon an expedition to the mountains, but just
what duty they were called to perform was
not stated in the brief message. All they
knew was that they were to leave at once for
a certain distant mountain-top, there pitch
tents and await orders for serious service.</p>

<p>On receipt of the news the other boys had
rushed off noisily with eager joy to don their
khaki uniforms and make ready, but Danny
had slipped down a by-street&mdash;a wounded, a
hurt thing, trying to hide his anguish away
from mortal sight. He would not be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to go&mdash;he knew it&mdash;for he was the only son
of a widowed mother who loved him all too
well. He was her all, her idol, and her days
had been spent in pampering and shielding
him.</p>

<p>Only a week before, the scouts had gone on
a hike together and she had refused absolutely
to allow Danny to accompany them&mdash;the
sun would be too hot, he might get
poisoned with wild ivy, he would be sure to
imbibe fever germs from the mountain spring!</p>

<p>No, thought the miserable boy, she would
be doubly fearful, doubly unwilling, now that
the Whippoorwills were to do serious scout
duty on Death Head Mountain.</p>

<p>Danny's soul raged against his soft fate as
he stumbled up the side steps of his handsome
home and entered his mother's presence.</p>

<p>He did not fly to her arms as he was wont
to do, but, instead, flung himself into the
first convenient chair with a frown. He
could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>But even in that moment of stress Danny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
realized that his mother had not hurried to
him for the usual kiss. She was struggling
with some sort of bundle, and she only looked
up with a quick smile.</p>

<p>The next instant, however, the smile of
welcome died out of her face, and she stopped
suddenly and regarded him with a startled
question in her eyes.</p>

<p>Danny frowned more darkly, and moved
uneasily under her searching gaze. He looked
away in a vain attempt to hide the tears
which had sprung to his eyes.</p>

<p>And then came the unexpected:</p>

<p>"Danny," said his mother, in a voice that
sounded new to him, "I received a long-distance
phone message from the Scout
Master, and&mdash;he said he had wired to the
school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then asked:
"Didn't you get the message?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy doggedly.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then his mother
deliberately put down the bundle she had
been working with, and approached. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
came and stood before him, with her back to
the table as if for support. Danny did not
look up into her face, though he saw her
white, jewelled hands grasping the edge of
the table, and they were strained and tense.</p>

<p>"My son," she said, "what is the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>He was too full to answer.</p>

<p>"Danny," she began again presently and
in that new voice, "you won't <i>do</i> this way&mdash;you
<i>will not</i>!" And then suddenly a white,
jewelled hand was struck fiercely upon the
table, and the new voice exclaimed passionately:</p>

<p>"Daniel Harding, if you sit around and
cry like a baby when you are called to the
service of your country, I'll&mdash;I'll <i>disown</i> you,
sir!"</p>

<p>"Mother!" And Danny sprang to her
arms.</p>

<p>There were a few moments of sobbing,
laughing confession from Danny, and then
his mother explained to him her unexpected
change of attitude toward scouting. Danger?&mdash;yes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of course she knew that this might involve
danger to him, but this call was for no
frolic&mdash;it was to the service of his country!
He <i>was</i> her all, everything in the world to
her, but the one thing which she could not,
would not bear would be to see him turn
"slacker" and coward when other mothers'
boys&mdash;not ten years older than Danny&mdash;were
already on the firing-line in France!</p>

<p>"Our part in this war is the old fight of
'76, Danny"&mdash;she said to him&mdash;"<i>nothing less
than that</i>! The Colonists fought to win independence
for America. We are fighting
now to save that independence won. And
if it takes every man in America&mdash;every boy
in America&mdash;if it takes <i>you</i>, Danny&mdash;there is
just one answer for an American to give."</p>

<p>And then the two of them hurriedly finished
tying up the bundle she had put aside.
It was his kit for the expedition!</p>

<p>It was a newer, bigger ideal of patriotism
which Danny Harding took with him into
his service on Death Head Mountain. His
mother, who loved him all too well, had yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
sent him from her with nothing short of her
positive orders to do his duty like a man.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The Whippoorwill Patrol had answered the
call to service, and the growing dusk found
its members arranging their camp for a night's
bivouac in a lonely stretch of woods "somewhere"
on the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>

<p>The Scout Master had not come, but his
orders had, and the Whippoorwills were busily
engaged in executing them.</p>

<p>"Camp in Mica Cove, conceal your fires,
and wait for me," the Scout Master had telegraphed.
"You are called to service."</p>

<p>So here they were in Mica Cove, hardily
preparing for whatever service to their country
it might be theirs to perform, and excitedly
guessing at what ominous circumstance
had necessitated their sudden calling
out.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody knew that old "Death
Head" must have come into some added
evil repute, and would have to be taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
hand. And that they would shortly be
scouting over all its lonely trails nobody had
any doubt whatever.</p>

<p>There were eight of them, for the whole
patrol was present. Youngest and happiest
of them all was the pink-cheeked, petted
tenderfoot, Danny Harding. He was no
"slacker," no "coward"! He was here with
the others to play a manly part in serving
his country, and his mother had sent him
from her with a smile!</p>

<p>Besides Danny, there were in the ranks L.
C. Whitman, nicknamed "Elsie," Ham and
Roger Gayle, Alex Batré, Ed Rowell, and
Biddie Burton&mdash;as husky and jolly a bunch
as could well be got together. All these were
older than Danny, and, as all were more or
less seasoned to scouting, they were quite
disposed to have their fun out of the new
recruit.</p>

<p>Danny took their teasing in good spirit,
however, for he felt that it was part of his
initiation into their envied circle. They were
big boys&mdash;brown like the woods of which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
had become a part, panther-footed, eagle-eyed,
efficient. Danny felt that he would be
willing to suffer much to become as they.</p>

<p>The tenderfoot watched them all to see
just how a scout was supposed to act, but it
was to Willard McKenzie, the resourceful
leader of the patrol, that his eyes turned
oftenest in frank admiration.</p>

<p>McKenzie was the oldest of the bunch&mdash;quite
seventeen&mdash;and five years of scouting
had stamped him a man as Nature meant
him to be. He knew and could answer every
bird-call, could follow a wood-trail unerringly,
could find himself in any emergency by the
chart of the stars above him. He was the
trusted friend of every wild thing about him,
and brother to every wind that blew. The
tenderfoot watched the graceful movements
of the leader's Indianlike figure, studied his
genius for quiet command, and decided
promptly to be, one day, a second Willard
McKenzie.</p>

<p>In obedience to McKenzie's orders, the
boys built their camp-fire within the cove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
where it would be hidden on three sides by
peaks which towered above, and on the
fourth by a dense thicket.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon, the Scout Master, had not
come, nor did they know when to expect
him. But they knew enough to obey their
leader, and this they were proceeding to do.</p>

<p>It was a simple matter&mdash;getting the camp
ready&mdash;and the boys thoroughly enjoyed it.
As they were to sleep on the ground, rolled
in their blankets, they had merely to clear
the space about them of underbrush and
fallen timber, and build the fire for cooking.</p>

<p>Of course they talked of war as they worked,
for they were scouts in khaki, preparing for
action.</p>

<p>Ed Rowell claimed for cousin one of the
American engineers who fought their way
out of German captivity with their bare
fists. Batré's older brother was right then
cleaving his winged way through clouds of
battle in the service of the La Fayette Escadrille.
Whitman knew a man who knew a
man who was in the 167th Infantry Regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
when it made with others that now historic
march, knee-deep in French snows.</p>

<p>Danny said nothing, for he was a quiet,
thoughtful lad. But he had vividly in mind
a handsome fellow of only eighteen who,
until America's declaration of war, had Sunday
after Sunday carried the golden cross up
the aisle of the little Church of the Holy
Innocents to "Onward, Christian Soldiers."
Danny had heard his mother say that it
was that song which had sent the young
crucifer bearing the Red Cross of Mercy
right up to the German guns.</p>

<p>But their talk was not all serious. They
were brimming over with life, and they
laughed and scrapped and worked together
with a zest which made even bramble-cutting
enjoyable.</p>

<p>It was when the big fire was glowing red
and they set about preparing their evening
meal that the best part of the fun began.
Whoever has not broiled great slices of bacon
or toasted cold biscuits on sharpened sticks
before a cheery camp-fire, who has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
roasted sweet potatoes and green corn in
glowing ashes, who has not inhaled the aroma
from an old tin coffee-pot, spitting and sputtering
on a hot rock, should join the Boy
Scouts and hike back to the heart of nature.</p>

<p>Oh, but it was fun! All except the holding
in check of savage appetites till the mess
should be cooked. Ed Rowell had been detailed
to toast the biscuits, and repeatedly
threatened to "eat 'em alive" if they didn't
brown faster.</p>

<p>Danny, who, with Alex Batré, had been
directed to broil the bacon, couldn't for the
life of him keep from pinching off a crisp
edge now and then to nibble. And yet only
yesterday Danny Harding would have turned
up his nose at bacon. The stimulating fresh
air and the hard work of camp life had begun
to get in their good work on him.</p>

<p>On the other side of the fire from Danny,
Ham and Roger Gayle were roasting corn
and sweet potatoes in the ashes, and a little
beyond, Elsie Whitman was filling the water-cans
from a trickling mountain spring&mdash;while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Biddie Burton was busily engaged in getting
under everybody else's feet and teasing
whomever he could.</p>

<p>McKenzie, their leader, was momentarily
absent, having gone down to the road below
the cliff on which they were encamped to see
if their fire could be sighted from that point
through the screening thicket.</p>

<p>The boys had from the first been instructed
by McKenzie to keep their voices lowered.
They were there for serious service, he had
told them. And the necessity for stealth and
the promise of adventure had for a time
keyed them up to the highest pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>But when the interest of cooking supper
became uppermost&mdash;especially when the scent
of the bacon and coffee began to fill the air&mdash;thoughts
of adventure withdrew a little to a
distance and whispered merriment became the
order of the hour.</p>

<p>As was natural, they turned on the tenderfoot
their battery of teasing, and the tenderfoot
bore it as best he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
    "Its mother washes 'em," averred Biddie
Burton, coming up behind Danny and carefully
examining his ears as he knelt at his work.</p>

<p>"Sure she does," laughed Ham across the
fire, "and they say that a sore tooth in its
little mouth aches everybody in the family
connection."</p>

<p>"Look out there, something's burning!"
broke in Ed Rowell suddenly. And the next
moment Ham and Roger were busy rescuing
from the fire the scorching potatoes.</p>

<p>"I declare," scolded Biddie, lounging up,
"I could beat you fellows cooking, with both
hands tied behind me."</p>

<p>"Why haven't you ever done it, then?"
snapped the elder Gayle, sore over his partial
failure.</p>

<p>"Why, nobody has ever tied my hands
behind me," came in seemingly hurt explanation
from Biddie, and the crowd laughed.</p>

<p>McKenzie had directed them not to wait
for him, and they did not. Another five
minutes found them eating like young wolves
around a languishing fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
    Later, when the fire winked lower, and the
meal was finished&mdash;when the screech-owls
began to send their blood-chilling, shivering
screams through the forest&mdash;they drew closer
together and began to talk of weird and
haunting things.</p>

<p>"Over yonder, on the real 'Death Head,'"
began Roger, bringing the interest down to
the spot, "is the haunted tree where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look out," broke in young Rowell, "a
little more of that and friend Danny over
here will cut for home and mother."</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind; I'm not a
baby!" exclaimed Danny indignantly. But
all the same, his heart was already in his
mouth, for Danny had never been distinguished
for signal bravery.</p>

<p>"No, you are not 'a baby,'" put in the unquenchable
Biddie, "but before we get out
of these woods you are going to wish you
<i>were</i> a baby, and a <i>girl</i> baby at that!"</p>

<p>Danny did not reply to this. He only sat
very still, wishing that Willard McKenzie
would return from his prolonged trip, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
thinking of the mother who was looking to
him to play the man.</p>

<p>The scene lost its glow. The surrounding
forest grew darker, taller, and began stealing
up closer about them.</p>

<p>"If you cry like a baby&mdash;!" Danny's
mother was whispering to his sinking heart.</p>

<p>The others had fallen into an argument
about the exact location of the haunted tree,
but presently Ed Rowell asked impatiently:</p>

<p>"Well, what is it about the place, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Haunted!" exclaimed Ham. "A murderer,
hunted with dogs through the mountains,
hanged himself on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the old tree died in the night," assisted
his brother. "And it stands there now,
naked and stark and dead. At night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Danny's heart stood still to hear.</p>

<p>"At night," broke in Whitman, "if you
creep up close, you can see the dead man
swinging in the wind!"</p>

<p>"<i>Listen!</i>" exclaimed Biddie under his
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    It will have to be recorded that they all
jumped violently at the exclamation.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded L. C.</p>

<p>"And hear old Danny being quiet!"
finished the teasing scamp.</p>

<p>"You bet you, and he'd better be quiet&mdash;"
began Roger.</p>

<p>But Whitman interrupted:</p>

<p>"Danny's afraid of ghosts, anyway," he
declared, "I tried to leave him in the graveyard
once, but he was home in his mama's
lap before I started running."</p>

<p>"I'm not any more afraid of ghosts than
you are," Danny protested hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>aren't</i> you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not!"</p>

<p>"All right, then," the big boy taunted;
"I've been to the haunted tree by myself at
night&mdash;these fellows all know I have&mdash;now
suppose <i>you</i> go."</p>

<p>"Sure, tenderfoot," put in young Rowell;
"here's a perfectly good chance to show your
nerve."</p>

<p>"He hasn't any," sneered Alex Batré.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
    But Danny drew back, aghast at the proposition&mdash;go
alone to a spot like that, and at night!</p>

<p>"Go to it, kid," was suddenly spoken
quietly in his ear.</p>

<p>Danny turned to see whose was the kindly
voice that advised, and looked into Biddie
Burton's eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't let 'em make you take a dare,"
came in another whisper. "<i>Go.</i>" Biddie was
not smiling now, and there was a note of
serious friendliness in his voice.</p>

<p>It suddenly came to Danny that he would
give more to merit that new confidence on
Biddie's part than to break down the taunts
of the others. And yet he could not. He
could no more command his shaking nerves
to carry him to that unhallowed, ghostly
spot than he could command the unwilling
nerves of another. His will-power had deserted
him.</p>

<p>"I <i>dare</i> you to go!" badgered L. C.</p>

<p>Danny's spirit flamed for one brief moment.
But in the very next his head dropped, and
he turned away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
    "This is going too far," the wretched little
fellow heard Biddie Burton exclaim sharply.</p>

<p>"What is 'going too far'?" a new voice
asked out of the darkness, and Willard
McKenzie advanced into the group. "What
is 'going too far'?" he repeated, glancing
from one to another. No answer being volunteered,
his keen glance quickly singled out
the shamed tenderfoot.</p>

<p>"What have they been up to, Danny?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Danny turned and faced him.</p>

<p>"Nothing that makes any difference," he
said.</p>

<p>It was generous in him not to "peach," and
so Biddie Burton's friendly glance assured
him.</p>

<p>The incident passed with that, for McKenzie
was full of something repressed, and,
seeing it, the boys gathered close about him
in eager questioning&mdash;all except Danny.</p>

<p>All except Danny! His brief career&mdash;his
career that only an hour ago had promised
so much&mdash;had ended, and in disgrace. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
had taken a dare! Nothing would ever matter
to him again&mdash;Danny told his aching heart&mdash;the
boys despised him, all except Biddie
Burton, and, somehow, Biddie's pity was
harder to bear than despite.</p>

<p>"I went to the gap and wired Mr. Gordon,"
McKenzie was saying now, "and he
told me I could put you to it at once. He's
had an accident to his car and may not get
here for some time."</p>

<p>"What's up?" It was Roger who asked
the question.</p>

<p>"Something serious," answered McKenzie,
"but Mr. Gordon didn't say what.
Have you had supper?"</p>

<p>They replied in concert, eager to receive
orders.</p>

<p>"Well," continued McKenzie, "we've got
to cover the mountain here, for signs of&mdash;anything
unusual. You'll have to be careful
not to run into trouble yourselves, but you
must know your ground. There'll be a good
moon if the clouds break."</p>

<p>"Glory be!" Danny heard Elsie Whitman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
breathe in expectant ecstasy, and he would
have given the world to have felt with him
that eager joy. But Danny had taken a
dare!</p>

<p>The others were chattering now, as eager
as Whitman to be off on the trail of adventure.</p>

<p>McKenzie was giving orders:</p>

<p>"Whitman, you can take the north trail,
and bear down over the mountain. Ham
will strike out down the creek to the left
there, and work around to your territory.
There's an old cabin hidden by scrub-oaks
and rocks about a quarter below the bridge
there, Ham. Know it for what it is, but
don't you run your long neck into danger."</p>

<p>In spite of his hurt Danny was getting interested.
He crept up on the outer edge of
the group and listened, wide-eyed, as the
other boys eagerly accepted their several
commissions.</p>

<p>"Roger and Ed," their leader was continuing,
"bear south till you get below the drop
of the cliff, and then separate and work that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
territory between you"&mdash;with a sweeping
gesture. "Alex and Biddie&mdash;let me see&mdash;you
two go over the mountain to the right of
Elsie&mdash;No, there's the Death Head trail&mdash;"
He paused a moment in thoughtful survey of
them, and the boys looked at each other apprehensively.
Not one of them was anxious
to work the trail of evil name. Suddenly,
however, McKenzie's eyes lighted on Danny
Harding, and an inspiration seemed to come
to him.</p>

<p>"Say," he exclaimed, "I'll give the new
recruit a chance at that. Come here, scout."
And he laid a kind hand on Danny's shoulder
and drew him into the circle.</p>

<p>Somebody on the outskirts of the group
laughed.</p>

<p>"Now you are going to do your first service
for your country," McKenzie said to the
tenderfoot; "but whatever you do, be wary,
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Somebody else laughed, and McKenzie
looked about sharply. "What's the joke?"
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
    "Danny's afraid," the mocker explained;
"that's where the dead man swings."</p>

<p>Biddie strolled forward. "Alex will be
enough to work Elsie's right," he said to
McKenzie. "Give me the Death Head trail.
You'll need Dan here about the camp."</p>

<p>But Danny raised his head quickly. It is
true that his face was dead-white, but his
head was up.</p>

<p>"I'll go to the Death Head," he said to
McKenzie.</p>

<p>The crowd was dumb-struck.</p>

<p>"But you got white-livered and backed
down&mdash;" L. C. began, after the first shock of
his surprise.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go when you dared me to,"
said the tenderfoot, "but this is&mdash;different."
And he added in his heart: "This is for <i>my
country</i>."</p>

<p>"But he <i>is</i> afraid," put in Roger. "Look
at him!"</p>

<p>McKenzie took a long, straight look into
Danny's white face and determined eyes, and
then turned to Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
    "All the gamer of him," he said, "to go in
spite of being afraid&mdash;that's the stuff that
Pershing is looking for. And Mr. Gordon
says that a boy who 'isn't afraid of anything'
hasn't sense enough to be trusted with a
commission. "Kid," he continued, turning
to Danny, "you find out all that there is to
be known about the Death Head vicinity before
you show up in camp again."</p>

<p>"All right," said Danny.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of surprise among them
at the tenderfoot's final acceptance of the
commission, but not one of them&mdash;not even
Biddie&mdash;believed that he would be able to
carry it through. And the sensitive, high-strung
Danny went out from among them
burdened with the feeling that they did not
look for him to succeed.</p>

<p>McKenzie walked a little way with him&mdash;big-brother
fashion, with an arm over his
shoulder&mdash;and gave him careful directions as
to how to proceed. There would be a moon
if the clouds broke, his leader warned him,
and he was to keep to the shadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    "I'll be leaving camp myself," said McKenzie,
"and will not show up again for a couple
of hours. You will probably get back before
the rest of us, so just roll up in your
blanket and lie close under that ledge yonder&mdash;you
will be perfectly safe there." A little
farther up the mountain trail and McKenzie
paused.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the dead man, scout,"
he admonished finally, "but keep your eye
peeled for the live one, and&mdash;'the best of
luck!'"</p>

<p>"'The best of luck!'" That was what
the men at the front said to a fellow when he
was going over the top of the shielding trench
into the dangerous unknown.</p>

<p>At the familiar phrase in parting, Danny
drew a quick, deep breath. Yes, he was
going "over the top"&mdash;and he was going
<i>alone</i>!</p>

<p>Then McKenzie slipped quietly back, and
Danny started forward up the long, dark
trail alone. The ghost of a moon showed
dimly through the black cloud-rack, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and again, and fitfully relieved the enveloping
darkness.</p>

<p>Only once did Danny look back. That
was when he came to the first turn in the
mountain trail which his leader had carefully
explained to him. Beyond that turn, and it
would be good-by to the last cheering, reassuring
gleam of their camp-fire, to the last
faint sound of comforting voices.</p>

<p>Danny paused and looked back. Only
two remained in the bright circle toward
which his rapidly chilling spirit was reaching
back. He recognized at once the tall,
slim form of McKenzie, but&mdash;&mdash; Yes, that
chunky one was Biddie Burton. The two
of them were standing close together, talking
earnestly. And now Danny caught, by a
sudden leap of the firelight, the fact that they
were looking toward him. Biddie was nodding.</p>

<p>It was so bright, so safe back there where
they had laughed and feasted and wrangled
together. Then suddenly Danny thought of
the young crucifer in the little Church of the
Holy Innocents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"Onward, Christian Soldiers!"</p>

<p>The next moment Danny was groping, feeling
his trembling way, but that way was
<i>onward</i>. The heart in his breast beat an
alarm to every nerve in his body, but he kept
his face toward the dim, dark trail. A lump
rose in his throat and threatened to choke
him. He gulped it down, and crept forward.</p>

<p>McKenzie had told him that a scout must
keep his head. That was the hardest part.
A fellow could force himself to go blindly to
a haunted spot at night, but to think, to
plan, to watch as he went&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>But he was a scout, and a scout must "be
prepared." Danny forced himself to think
as he went. He was not following that gruesome
trail in response to Whitman's dare&mdash;he
was scouting old Death Head in the service
of his country.</p>

<p>Danny found that he could follow McKenzie's
directions better than he had hoped.
Now that his eyes were thoroughly accustomed
to the dark, he could descry the blacker
landmarks for which his leader had prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him. After the turn in the mountain trail,
an abrupt and jagged cliff ahead beckoned the
way. The shadow of the cliff won, Danny
waited for another appearance of the pale,
cold moon by the help of whose light he
hoped to locate the three giant pines&mdash;his
next objective. From the pines, McKenzie
had told him, old Death Head could be
sighted plainly enough, for from that point
it was silhouetted, black and unmistakable,
against the sky, and its summit was
marked by the stark, white, blasted tree of
evil fame.</p>

<p>"That's where the dead man swings!"
echoed in Danny's memory. And for a moment
it seemed that he <i>must</i> give up and fly
back to safety. But something said: "I'll
disown you, sir!" And Danny again turned
his face in the direction of his duty.</p>

<p>The moon looked out of the drifting clouds.
Danny located the three giant pines in the
distance, and for one blessed moment saw a
reasonably clear path, skirting along the
mountainside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
    Darkness again! But Danny took the
skirting path to the pine giants.</p>

<p>Once he nearly lost his nerve altogether,
for suddenly there was behind him a sound
as if some human foot had stumbled. The
tenderfoot dropped warily to the long grass
at one side of the path, and listened. A long,
long time he listened, but not another sound
did he hear. At length he told himself that
the step was that of some wild creature which
he had disturbed.</p>

<p>Then forward again! Creeping, panther-footed.</p>

<p>Danny reached the pines at last&mdash;and sure
enough, old Death Head rose all too plainly
before him. He saw, or thought he saw, a
tall white something on its summit.</p>

<p>In thinking it over afterward, Danny was
never quite sure just what happened between
the pines and the haunted tree. He had a
vague recollection of imagining that step behind
again, and he recalled at one point the
almost welcome pain of a stubbed toe. But for
the rest, he was too frightened to take it all in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
    By the time the tenderfoot reached the
summit of old Death Head and stood within
fifty feet of the haunted tree, he was too
frightened to move, and he almost <i>expected</i>
to see the thing which he most feared. The
sky was overcast again, but a dim white
something towered before him&mdash;the haunted
tree&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>But just at that moment the clouds broke,
and the full moon, now all unveiled, flooded
the scene with light.</p>

<p>Naked, stark, ghostly, the blasted pine-tree
rose before him. With a sudden spasm
at his heart Danny looked for the swinging
dead man. But if anything unearthly hung
from those bare white branches, his mortal
eyes were spared the vision. And presently
his awakening reason began to urge: "There
are no such things as 'ghosts.'"</p>

<p>The next moment the young scout came
fully to himself, and withdrew quickly from
the all-revealing flood of moonlight to the
friendly shadow of a low shrub. He began
to peer sharply about. The growth around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
was ragged, with great spaces between. If
there was anything here that a scout ought
to note, the opportunity was ideal.</p>

<p>He must perform the duty for which he
was here! His leader had told him to
know the spot before he showed up in camp
again.</p>

<p>Danny began skirting about in the shadows,
getting every angle he could on the scene,
and exploring adjacent wood lanes. It is
true that he kept well away from the haunted
tree, but he came back to its vicinity every
now and then. And each time as he came
he managed to force himself to approach it
closer.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer he got to it, and then,
suddenly, he heard issue from somewhere in
its branches a low, sighing moan. Danny
thought he would drop in his tracks, but he
did not. Instead, he stood as still as death
and listened.</p>

<p>That moan again! Every time a gust of
wind came, the dim, weird sound trembled
along the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
    The moon was shining brilliantly now.
Danny stood staring at the haunted tree.</p>

<p>All at once he crept forward, sharply intent
on something.</p>

<p>What was that straight black line against
the sky? Where did it come from?&mdash;that
haunted tree?</p>

<p>Another moment and Danny was at the
foot of the ghostly pine-tree, staring upward
at the crisscross of its naked branches.</p>

<p>There was no swinging dead man there,
but there was <i>something</i>&mdash;at the top!</p>

<p>Danny dropped to the ground and retreated
a little on all fours for a better view-point.
'Way up, two parallel black bars rose against
the sky.</p>

<p>A scout must keep his head!</p>

<p>Now, no boughs of a tree ever grew that
straight! And what were those orderly black
lines which extended from one bar to the
other?</p>

<p>That moan again!&mdash;or&mdash;or was it the sound
of a wire, played upon by the wind?</p>

<p>Danny shifted his position again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
    Yes, that black line across the sky connected
directly with the queer something in
the tree top.</p>

<p>"<i>Wireless!</i>" said the scout's head to him.</p>

<p>Danny stood up. All childish fear of a
swinging ghost had dropped away from him.
He had not the slightest inclination now to
cry like a baby about anything.</p>

<p>He was a scout on duty!</p>

<p>Another moment and he was creeping,
velvet-footed, through the woods, following
that black line as it led away from the haunted
tree. At the other end of it must be a receiving-station!</p>

<p>And it was no easy task which his duty set
him. Over sharp rocks and through tangled
briers that black line led him on. Sometimes
the moon would desert him and he would lose
the clue for a while. Sometimes he would
be forced to abandon his clue to skirt around
an insuperable barrier. But he always came
back to it, always pressed on.</p>

<p>On and on! And then, suddenly, the line
disappeared. It ended, or seemed to end in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
large pile of boulders which clung to the mountainside.
The undergrowth was dense here.</p>

<p>Danny circled about the spot. Yes, the
wire stopped here. He began creeping through
the underbrush&mdash;feeling his way along the
side of a great boulder.</p>

<p>Suddenly his hand touched&mdash;<i>nothing</i>!</p>

<p>The scout stopped and thought. There
was some sort of break in the rock here.</p>

<p>Danny had a flashlight in his pocket which
he had been too cautious to use. He thought
of it now, and hesitated. Then he slipped
it out and pressed the spring.</p>

<p>Before him was what seemed the door of a
cave. He looked closer. Yes, the wire led
into the cave. Darkness, again, for he was
afraid to use his light any longer.</p>

<p>Danny dropped to his all-fours and crept
into the black hole. A floor of soft sand
helped him to advance noiselessly. After a
few yards the scout reached a turn in the
rocky passageway, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His eye caught a big, black-hooded shadow
humped over a point of light!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
    Danny withdrew quickly behind the sheltering
turn in the wall, and crouched in the
sand, dead-still. But his blood was up. He
took a second look.</p>

<p>A man was sitting over some sort of instrument,
and over his ears were cups, something
like Danny had seen worn by the girl at the
telephone central station. The one point of
light in the big dark recess was turned on a
note-book under the man's hand.</p>

<p>The young scout drew back, and crept
silently out of the cavern.</p>

<p>Out under the stars again, and this time
with his blood on fire! A spy, a German
spy sat in that cave and sent messages&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Only yesterday a fleet of transports had
slipped out of the harbor, with thousands of
American soldiers on board&mdash;submarines&mdash;sea-raiders!</p>

<p>But a scout must keep his head.</p>

<p>Help? Which way could help be found?
The boys were scattered, McKenzie would
not be in camp. Nobody knew when to expect
Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
    Which way? Which way? Oh, yes, down
over the drop of the cliff to the south yonder
was the mountain wagon road by which their
scouting party had ascended that afternoon.
If he could get to the road he could find
somebody somewhere&mdash;surely, there were a
few inhabitants hereabouts!</p>

<p>That German was sending wireless messages
right this minute&mdash;&mdash; Yes, the shortest way
to the road was the only way for a fellow to
take now! And Danny took it.</p>

<p>When he reached the cliff, spent and sore,
a new difficulty presented itself. A sheer
fifty-foot drop still separated him from the
road. He crept along the edge searching for
a footing by which to descend, and presently
found one that looked possible. There were
broken, shelving places here, and tufts of
growing things down the face of the dizzy
wall.</p>

<p>Danny began to climb down. But he
found it harder than he had thought, and at
times he was a mere human fly clinging to a
rock wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p0036a-illus.jpg" id="p0036a-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0036a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="769" alt="A spy sending messages" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">A man was sitting over some sort of instrument.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
    Nearly down&mdash;only about fifteen feet more!
But at that moment the human fly's hold
crumbled under his clinging fingers, and he
dropped. It ought not to have been a bad
fall, but the trouble was a loosened rock followed,
and came down on one arm as its
owner lay prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p>Danny lay very still for a few moments,
looking at the stars and thinking of&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p>Then presently the sound of human voices
came to him from somewhere out of the night.
With an effort he raised up a little to push
off the stone from his arm, but he dropped
back again.</p>

<p>The stars began to swim at that, and the
voices to grow fantastic.</p>

<p>But a scout&mdash;must&mdash;keep&mdash;his head!</p>

<p>Those voices sounded familiar! Danny
summoned all his strength, and sent the wavering
call of a wounded whippoorwill along
the night.</p>

<p>Silence, and then a whippoorwill answered
sharply from out the forest.</p>

<p>Danny called again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
    Shortly after that came low voices and the
sound of hurrying feet. Then Mr. Gordon,
the Scout Master, McKenzie, their leader,
and jolly old Biddie Burton were hovering
over him.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" they asked in one breath.</p>

<p>But Danny cried out feverishly: "There's
a German spy sending wireless messages from
old Death Head, and our transports have put
to sea!" And he told them, brokenly, the
story of his find.</p>

<p>There was consternation among them for
one brief moment, and then everybody woke
to action.</p>

<p>They must get the man at once&mdash;but <i>which
way</i> to go?</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon spoke quickly:</p>

<p>"You stay with Danny, Burton; McKenzie
and I will go back to the Death Head and
follow the clue from there." And even as he
spoke he and McKenzie were hurriedly, but
tenderly, binding up the wounded arm, while
Biddie improvised a comforting sling for it.</p>

<p>But Danny knew that the route by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
old Death Head was long and circuitous.
And he knew also that the shortest way is
the only way to take when one's duty to
one's country calls.</p>

<p>He got to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll show you the shortest way," he said.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>How they found means of scaling the cliff,
how they accomplished their stealthy journey
back to the hidden wireless station,
piloted by the wounded tenderfoot whom
they supported at every step, is too long a
story to tell.</p>

<p>But they reached the mouth of the dark
cave. The two boys were left outside, and
very shortly thereafter Mr. Gordon and
McKenzie brought out between them a big
shadowy figure with its hands bound together.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>That night, the east-bound passenger was
flagged at the little station in the valley,
and there boarded it a squad of boy scouts
with their leaders, who guarded between them
a captured German spy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
    "Gordon, how did you manage it?" called
a voice, from some distance down the long
coach as they entered.</p>

<p>For answer, Mr. Gordon took hold of a little
boy who wore his left arm in a sling and,
pushing him gently forward, said before that
whole car full of curious, excited people:</p>

<p>"We had an American on guard to-night."</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The Probate Judge's office in the old courthouse
on the square was, the next morning,
the scene of a most unusual gathering.</p>

<p>Danny and his mother had been asked by
the Scout Master to meet him there at ten
o'clock. Mr. Gordon had sent his request
in the form of a brief note which explained
that the Boy Scout Court of Honor was to
be in session that morning, and said that he
wished his youngest scout to be present.</p>

<p>Danny's mother was strangely elated over
the request, but Danny did not know why.
He was so young in the business of scouting
that some details of the system had not yet
become definitely his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
    He ventured one surmise when the note
was read&mdash;something in connection with
the taking of that German spy, of course.
Maybe the Whippoorwills were to be commended
for delivering the goods. And
Danny's mind's eye recalled again the stirring
scene&mdash;McKenzie and Mr. Gordon marshalling
to the station between them the big
German whom they had captured and bound,
and he and the other scouts trudging along
in excited escort. It was a wonderful thing
to be a man, Danny thought wistfully&mdash;to
be big and strong enough to lay a compelling
hand on the enemy in our midst and say:</p>

<p>"I want you!"</p>

<p>But it will have to be recorded that
Danny's mother acted a little queerly on
receipt of the note. When Danny said that
perhaps the Whippoorwills were to be commended
for "delivering the goods," his
mother looked up at him quickly, as if in
surprise. Then she laughed a little and cried
a little, and then she dashed off for her hat
and wraps like a girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
    At ten o'clock sharp, Danny and his mother
presented themselves at Judge Sledge's door.
As they paused to knock, a voice came to
them through the closed door&mdash;a familiar
voice, and it sounded very earnest. Then
the door was opened in response to their
knock.</p>

<p>They hesitated a moment while they took
in the quiet, dignified scene within. Portly
old Judge Sledge was sitting well forward
in his office chair with his spectacles pushed
back upon his bald head, while Doctor Cranfield
and several gentlemen whom Danny
knew only by sight were grouped about him.
All were in the attitude of listening intently to
a man who stood before them&mdash;Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>Danny's quick glance took in all this, including
the background of khaki-clad Whippoorwills,
plastered against the wall beyond.</p>

<p>The gentlemen rose, on the entrance of
Mrs. Harding, and the scouts crowded forward
to whisper excitedly to Danny.</p>

<p>But Danny did not have time to listen to
them, for Doctor Cranfield&mdash;taking him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
his good arm&mdash;turned him about, and said
to the company:</p>

<p>"This is the boy."</p>

<p>There was an agonizing moment to Danny
in which he realized that everybody in the
room was looking at him. Then he had to
be introduced. It was very, very trying,
for each man to whom Danny gave his hand
in greeting looked him over from head to
foot, and made embarrassingly personal, if
kindly, remarks about him.</p>

<p>"He was a small chap for the job."</p>

<p>"He ought to be <i>red-headed</i>."</p>

<p>"He was his mother's son."</p>

<p>Danny looked across the group into his
mother's eyes and caught there an expression
which he was never to forget. And she
was smiling&mdash;in spite of the tear-mist over
her beautiful eyes&mdash;she was smiling.</p>

<p>When they resumed their seats, there returned
upon the group the touch of ceremonial
quiet and earnestness which the entrance
of the newcomers had for the moment
dispelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
    Mr. Gordon took a chair behind Mrs.
Harding and explained to her and Danny in
a low tone that the session was nearly over.
Judge Sledge had been compelled to convene
the court earlier than the appointed hour.</p>

<p>The other men were talking apart. Presently,
one of them turned to the Scout
Master and said:</p>

<p>"Following what you have just related,
Mr. Gordon&mdash;do you think that it was quite
wise in your patrol leader to send out a mere
tenderfoot on a really dangerous commission?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was about to reply, when
McKenzie stepped forward and saluted.
"May I answer that?" he asked.</p>

<p>The court assented, and all turned to hear.</p>

<p>"Our private advices had been," began
McKenzie, with his Indianlike figure drawn
up to its full height, "that it was Camelback
Mountain which was under suspicion. We
located our camp on a parallel range, and
miles from the suspected vicinity. Mr. Gordon
and I and several of the older boys were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
later to take in hand the serious work of
Camelback, but we thought it well to give
the others a little experience. I had not intended
to employ the tenderfoot till I overheard
the boys teasing him. I sent him to
the Death Head to redeem himself in his
own eyes and in theirs."</p>

<p>"Please, may I speak?" Biddie Burton
had come forward eagerly.</p>

<p>With the permission of the judge, Biddie
hurried on:</p>

<p>"Without letting the other boys know,
McKenzie told me to follow Danny in case
his courage should give out completely. But
he gave me my orders to keep well in the
rear. He wanted Dan to go to the haunted
tree by himself, if he would&mdash;to win his spurs,
you see."</p>

<p>"Did you follow Harding all the way?"
someone interrupted.</p>

<p>"All the way to the haunted tree? Yes,
sir, and he <i>did</i> go! He went right up to it
and circled all about it. Then the earth
seemed to open and swallow him up. I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and looked for him. Then I ran back for
help. I found McKenzie and Mr. Gordon,
and we all three started out after Dan. You
have heard the rest."</p>

<p>This seemed satisfactory, and the judge
turned to Danny.</p>

<p>"Come here, Daniel," he said, "and tell
the court now how you captured your wireless
operator."</p>

<p>Danny started.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it, sir," he said in embarrassment.
"Mr. Gordon and Willard McKenzie
captured the man. I only showed them
where he was."</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Well," said the judge, again, "come here
and tell us what you <i>did do</i>."</p>

<p>Danny came forward.</p>

<p>"Salute!" he heard Biddie whisper.</p>

<p>Danny saluted.</p>

<p>"Now," said the judge, "tell these gentlemen
here what&mdash;what you told <i>your mother</i>
when you got back from the mountains last
night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
    Danny looked at his mother. Her eyes
were misty again, but she was nodding to
him to do as the judge directed.</p>

<p>The tenderfoot stood embarrassed before
them and told the story exactly as he had
related it to his mother. He didn't like to
do this, for he was very much ashamed of
having to tell how frightened he had been,
and how he had had to force himself to go
forward.</p>

<p>The men listened intently. Once in a
while one would interrupt to ask a question.</p>

<p>When Danny got to the point in his story
of his acceptance of McKenzie's commission
to cover old Death Head, a dark-eyed, quiet
man on the judge's right leaned forward.</p>

<p>"One moment, Harding," he said. "McKenzie
told us before you entered that you
were afraid to go when the boys dared you,
but that when he told you to go on the scouting
trip, you said, 'this is different.' What
did you mean by its being 'different'?"</p>

<p>Danny looked up from his nervous fingering
of the judge's paper-weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
    "I meant that it was for my country,"
he answered simply.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed man glanced at the others.</p>

<p>"<i>Beat that</i>," he said in a low tone to
them.</p>

<p>Judge Sledge took down his spectacles
from his bald head, adjusted them on his
nose, and looked hard at the boy.</p>

<p>"Proceed," he commanded, after a moment.</p>

<p>Danny proceeded.</p>

<p>"Weren't you afraid to crawl into that
cave?" one of them asked in the course of
the story.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Danny.</p>

<p>Later, another interrupted with:</p>

<p>"But if your arm was broken and paining
you, why didn't you stay with Burton, there,
and let the others go by the way of Death
Head, and take up the clue you had followed?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," answered Danny, "we
had to get to the man quickly to stop his
telegraphing. I knew a short route to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
    "Exactly," said the judge, nodding, then
he turned to the men about him.</p>

<p>"All right, gentlemen?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was a whispered conference of a
few moments, and then, to Danny's surprise,
they all turned to him.</p>

<p>"Daniel," said the judge, "do you know
why this Court of Honor has been called
into session?"</p>

<p>Danny's glance swept the khaki-clad
figures against the wall&mdash;he looked at Mr.
Gordon.</p>

<p>"I hope," he answered to the judge, "that
you like what we did."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the judge, smiling this time,
"yes, the Whippoorwills are quite in our
good graces, and we commend the promptness
and efficiency of Mr. Gordon and your
leader, McKenzie. However, this court has
been called together to sit in judgment on
<i>your</i> part in last night's performance. Daniel,
do you realize that you have done bravely
and well?"</p>

<p>Danny stood for one moment, stunned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the dawning realization of what this meant.
Then he looked across at his mother. Life
holds for a boy no higher, happier moment
than that in which he realizes he has made
his mother proud of him.</p>

<p>Without waiting for him to reply, the judge
was continuing:</p>

<p>"This court finds, Danny, that in spite
of very human, very natural fears, and at
the cost of suffering to yourself, you performed
a service to your country which may
be more far-reaching than any of us dream.
And if there is anything braver than the
conquering of fear, anything more manly
than the voluntary endurance of pain for
a high cause, or any earthly motive of action
higher than one's duty to one's country, we
have never found it.</p>

<p>"Now, Son, it is not within the power of
this, our local court, to confer upon you what
we think you deserve. It is ours, however,
to recommend to the Boy Scout National
Court of Honor that you be awarded the
Honor Medal. This we are going to do because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
we believe you have saved more than
life by your prompt action, and we know
that you did it at the cost of suffering to
yourself and at the risk of your own life."</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>When, a few weeks later, the Honor Medal
did arrive and was pinned upon Danny's
breast, the young scout found it necessary
to take his little mother in hand.</p>

<p>"'If you cry like a baby,'" he whispered
laughingly but with his arms about her,
"'I'll <i>disown</i> you!'"</p>

<h2>UNDER THE FLAG</h2>

<p>"<i>Louise!</i>"</p>

<p>The little girl came to a halt suddenly
and nearly dropped her book-satchel.
Somebody had called her name&mdash;some startling,
mysterious voice had called her!</p>

<p>She looked hurriedly about, but there was
nobody in sight&mdash;nobody but a saucy squirrel
perched upon a park bench, and a redbird flitting
along the open between the enclosing
hawthorns.</p>

<p>Which one had called?</p>

<p>"<i>Louise!</i>"</p>

<p>The little girl started back, too frightened
to scream&mdash;it was the hawthorn!</p>

<p>But the next moment a boyish bullet-head
appeared between parted boughs.</p>

<p>"Come here!" exclaimed its owner in suppressed
excitement. "We've got something
to tell you!"</p>

<p>Down went the book-satchel, but not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
fear this time. Billy Hastings had called&mdash;called
excitedly&mdash;and Billy was known to furnish
nearly all the third-grade thrills there
were. So the next moment Louise was stooping
her way under the hawthorn boughs in
answer to her playfellow's summons.</p>

<p>Billy was not alone in the green grotto in
which Louise presently found herself, for
nearly half the third-grade members were
there. There was wide-eyed Tinsie Willis,
with her little frilly skirts bristling with excitement,
with Mamie Moore swallowing to
keep back hysterical tears, and Sadie and
Lallie Raiford, with their backs to each other
for safe-keeping. And there were boys, a
whole mob of boys!</p>

<p>The children were huddled together in suppressed
excitement, and were whispering all at
the same time. It was plain that something
terrible, something menacing, had happened.</p>

<p>"You know that new boy that came to
school this morning&mdash;?" began one.</p>

<p>"That 'Rudolph Kreisler'?" put in another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
    "Sh-h-h!" interrupted a third wildly.</p>

<p>But Billy Hastings thrust his red, round
face close to Louise's and announced in a
blood-curdling whisper:</p>

<p>"<i>Rudolph Kreisler is a German spy!</i>"</p>

<p>Louise's legs crumpled under her, and she
sat down in a heap.</p>

<p>Again they were all talking at the same
time, and this time at her.</p>

<p>"He's got his trousers' pockets just <i>full</i> of
something!" exclaimed Pete Laslie.</p>

<p>"And he's watching, <i>watching</i>!" put in
another. "Didn't you see him sitting off
there by himself looking at us while we played
ball?"</p>

<p>"Spying!" hissed Luke Musgrove over
Billy Hastings's shoulder.</p>

<p>The children started and looked about apprehensively.
Luke's words always carried
weight by reason of the fact that he had been
two years in the third grade and ought to
know what he was talking about if he didn't.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in Billy, coming close to
Louise again and speaking in his most dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
tone. "Just you dare to draw a deep
breath, and he'll tell the Kaiser on you!"</p>

<p>Louise gasped&mdash;a short, a curtailed little
gasp. Never till the Great War should be
over would she breathe from her diaphragm
again!</p>

<p>"Oh-o-o-o, <i>Louise</i>!" from round-eyed Tinsie
Willis.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"You've left your book-satchel out there
in the path! Just suppose he were to come
by and see it!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of consternation, of
wild chattering, in which everybody poked
his head out to see, but nobody would venture
far enough to get the incriminating satchel.</p>

<p>Then Tommie Warren had an inspiration.
Snatching a crooked-handle umbrella from
Ella Vaiden, he flung himself flat on the grass
and reached for the tell-tale satchel with the
crook.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing Ella brought that umbrella!"
exclaimed Tinsie. And all looked at
Ella, who stood up very straight in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the low-dipping boughs. The next moment
Louise had her beloved book-satchel hugged
close to her pounding heart.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" suddenly came from a self-constituted
sentinel.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>He's coming!</i>"</p>

<p>The crowd in the bushes stood tiptoe and
breathless as the German spy came down the
hawthorn path.</p>

<p>He was a small lad&mdash;small for the third
grade&mdash;with big blue eyes and a shock of
tawny hair. The Kaiser had not equipped
him very well, for there was a suggestion of
poverty about his mended clothes. But,
after all, maybe those carefully darned places
at his knees were only a part of an adroit disguise.
His pockets <i>were</i> bulging, and with
knotty-looking somethings very suggestive of
poorly concealed bombs. He was not whistling,
as a perfectly good American would have
been, but walked slowly and with his head
down. It was very suspicious!</p>

<p>He passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
    "Let's get him now!" suggested Luke.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Billy. "Get some
rocks!" And instantly all was excitement,
the uncensored noise of which reached the little
German and caused him to take to his heels.</p>

<p>In the confusion of the next few moments
Louise scarcely realized what they were
about. But when they tore out of the bushes,
snatching up rocks as they went, and rushed
after their flying prey, her heart stood still.
He was such a <i>little</i> boy!</p>

<p>With the back of her hand pressed tight
against the sobs that would not be stifled, and
with tears raining down her cheeks, the little
girl followed in the wake of the howling mob.</p>

<p>Then somebody rounded a hawthorn bush
and came bang up against her. It was Jimmie
Fisher, a big, red-headed rock of strength,
who could carry lightly the heaviest book-satchels
there were.</p>

<p>"What are you crying about?" he asked,
after his first quick survey of her.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they are killing Rudolph Kreisler!"
sobbed Louise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
    "No," assured Jimmie, "he'll get home
free. He lives just across there. Are these
your books?"</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The next day matters only grew worse.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere of the third grade
had become electric with suspicion of a certain
little boy who, looking neither to right
nor to left, kept his wistful blue eyes bent on
the task before him. When Rudolph stood
up at the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner,
Luke growled out that he was "just pretending."
And when, from his seat near the
door, the German lad answered the knock of
a visitor, Ella Vaiden whispered audibly:</p>

<p>"See <i>that</i>? He wants to see <i>who's there</i>!"</p>

<p>In recitation Rudolph answered the questions
put to him with despicable German efficiency,
but Luke missed with conspicuous
patriotism and went noisily foot.</p>

<p>But through it all Louise was doing her
own thinking. She was a loyal little citizen
and loved her country with all her heart; but
there flowed through her veins the blood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a long line of Americans who had been just
and fair. The little girl was afraid of German
spies&mdash;afraid for her country&mdash;and Rudolph
Kreisler's pockets did bulge ominously.
If Rudolph Kreisler <i>was</i> a German spy, why
he would have to be dealt with, of course.</p>

<p>But if he wasn't&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Louise wished with all her heart that Miss
Barclay, the teacher, would suspect this terrible
smothered tragedy that was being enacted
within her class. Of course one's
teacher, like one's mother, could solve every
problem; and Miss Barclay in particular could
command the storms of childhood to be still.
If only Miss Barclay knew!</p>

<p>But in third-grade ethics it was "dishonorable"
to "tattle," so Louise was compelled
to hold her peace and think fast. There were
recesses ahead in which covertly cruel things
might happen, and an after-school walk
through a lonely park from which a real <i>little</i>
boy might not get home free. Something
must be done.</p>

<p>At first recess the boys and girls were, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
usual, separated in their play, but Louise&mdash;observing
from afar&mdash;saw that the little German
sat by himself on the steps, and watched
the spirited ball-play of the others with keen
alertness. Yes, it was very suspicious.</p>

<p>Big recess brought with it an unusual privilege
that day. The third-grade boys and
girls were to be allowed to mingle together
and on the front lawn, in order to keep them
from under the feet of certain workmen who
were making excavations through the school-grounds.</p>

<p>This was all very thrilling, for it was from
a tall staff on the front lawn that their
beautiful new flag was floating, and to-day
they would be able to see it close&mdash;to touch
the pole with their very hands! Then, too,
it would be so remarkable to play with
<i>boys</i>.</p>

<p>Louise pondered it all as the third-grade
girls filed down to their lunch-room. Rudolph
Kreisler was not there, of course, but Rudolph
would be with them among the other boys at
play-time. She would then be able to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
him narrowly&mdash;to keep an eye on those bulging
pockets.</p>

<p>All the other girls were chattering over
their lunch, but Louise drank her milk and
ate her sandwich in thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>Presently a hand was laid upon her heavy
curls and she looked up with a start. The
principal was smiling down at her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, little tragedy
queen?" he asked.</p>

<p>Louise blushed and tried vainly to reply.</p>

<p>The teacher serving the sandwiches answered
the principal.</p>

<p>"Of 'the impossibility of all things,'" she
said with a curious sidewise smile.</p>

<p>The principal put his hand under Louise's
chin and, tilting her head back, looked deep
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"You must run and play a great deal," he
said, and passed on.</p>

<p>Then, when the last sandwich had gone the
way of all good sandwiches, they repaired to
the front lawn.</p>

<p>It was all so wonderful&mdash;so green and cool
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and stately-looking. And there, sure enough,
was the great new flag, curling and uncurling
in the fitful wind&mdash;'way up against the
sky!</p>

<p>The boys were already out on the green
when the little girls were marched down the
steps and disbanded among them to enjoy
the most unusual privilege of joining in their
games. Then, all suddenly a great awkwardness
came down upon the girls. How was one
to play with boys at recess? Of course <i>after
school</i> it came natural enough to mingle with
them, but this was not "after school"! It
was most embarrassing.</p>

<p>Louise found herself timid in the chaperoned
recess-presence of Jimmie and Billy and
Luke, and began to back away toward the
steps.</p>

<p>"Look out!" shouted Billy suddenly.</p>

<p>Louise jumped to "look out." Behind her,
on the bottom step, sat the German spy.
She had nearly backed into him!</p>

<p>In the face of danger, embarrassment
dropped away. The next moment Louise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
had fled back to her countrymen and was listening,
excited, to their eager whispers.</p>

<p>"Rudolph Kreisler sits by himself&mdash;always
by himself. Isn't that funny?"</p>

<p>"Just look at him <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"See him watching the flag?"</p>

<p>"Get that gleam in his eye? Look, quick!"</p>

<p>"Old rascal! He got home free yesterday&mdash;but
just you wait!"</p>

<p>And so they stood apart from him and
whispered.</p>

<p>The German spy dug his toes in the sand
a little longer, then rose and moved a few
steps farther up.</p>

<p>Then Ella Vaiden declared that they were
wasting time, and proposed that they begin
a game.</p>

<p>But nobody knew what to play.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you!" exclaimed Louise. "Let's
play 'Under the Flag.'"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked several.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;" began Louise, inventing
the game as she proceeded, "it's this way:
you go stand under the flag and look up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
it till the wind blows it out straight&mdash;and&mdash;and
then you make a wish. If the flag floats
wide till you have finished, your wish will
come true."</p>

<p>All were interested at once, and the game
began. The fitful, boisterous wind took an
active part and the play became spirited.</p>

<p>Tinsie Willis was the first to come "under
the flag," but she was so excited she forgot
to wish till the broadly floating banner had
wrapped itself about its staff and her opportunity
was gone.</p>

<p>Then everybody began talking at once,
and Mamie Moore piped up: "I'm going to
wish for a pair of shiny-bug slippers!"</p>

<p>Louise was shocked, and quickly explained
that when one wished under the flag it must
be for something serious and from the very
depths of one's heart.</p>

<p>"Sure," supported Jimmie of the red head.
"You can wish for shiny-bug slippers under
an umbrella!"</p>

<p>But Mamie couldn't then think of anything
more serious than the need of gilt slippers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and was promptly ruled out till her
imagination should come to her assistance.</p>

<p>Several boys took turns next, but they
were so noisy and boisterous that they came
near spoiling everything.</p>

<p>Then Flora Archer took her place. Flora
was a thoughtful little girl who carried around
in her eyes a deep, deep something people
never understood. With her lips close to
the flagpole, she whispered her message to
it, and all the while the beautiful banner
streamed out to its farthest length.</p>

<p>Flora came back without speaking, and the
children looked at her in curious silence.
But when the others were noisily choosing
times again, Flora slipped her hand into
Louise's and whispered:</p>

<p>"I wished for our soldiers to win in the war,
but for them not to be cruel when they do."</p>

<p>"Yours, Louise!" exclaimed somebody.</p>

<p>And before Louise had time to examine the
depths of her heart to see what it was she
most desired, a half-dozen pair of friendly
hands pushed her forward. It was no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to hold back&mdash;to spoil the game. Louise
mounted the green knoll from which the
great flagpole rose.</p>

<p>But she did not at once look up. Her
glance had accidentally lighted on the lonely
figure on the steps, and was resting there
for a moment in startled contemplation.</p>

<p>He was such a <i>little</i> boy, and he seemed so&mdash;apart!
But one must make no mistakes
where one's country was involved. <i>Were</i> his
blue eyes "gleaming" with vengeful purpose?
Or were they only full&mdash;of shining tears?</p>

<p>"Look up! Look up!" the children called.</p>

<p>Louise threw back her head&mdash;threw it back
so far that the familiar scene about her became
lost to her view and she beheld nothing
but the vision above. Amid the battling
tree tops and against a threatening sky the
flag of freedom streamed out in all its rippling
glory&mdash;red for the courage of American
hearts, white for the purity of purpose they
should harbor, and blue for truth, like that
higher, farther heaven above the gathering
clouds. Now rippling, now curling, wreathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
snapping, and now&mdash;straight out, fronting
the coming storm!</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick!" the children shouted, as
Old Glory floated free.</p>

<p>Suddenly the child stretched up her hands.
It was not a wish, but a prayer, that her
young heart sent up to her country's flag.</p>

<p>"Help me to&mdash;play fair!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Louise saw her comrades only mistily when
she came down the green knoll again toward
them.</p>

<p>Then all became babel again.</p>

<p>"It's my time next!" exclaimed Luke
Musgrove, shouldering forward.</p>

<p>"Who said so?" demanded another.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> said so," answered the big boy rudely,
and he strode to his place against the flagpole.
"I wish," he began in a loud, strident
voice, and without waiting for the wind to
come hurtling across the green, "I wish <i>to
wring the neck of that German spy</i>!"</p>

<p>All eyes were quickly turned from the flag
to where a little wide-eyed boy shrank back
in terror against the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
    "Glory be!" shouted Billy Hastings.
"Teacher's gone in&mdash;let's drag Rudolph under
the flag!"</p>

<p>Instantly the flame of persecution swept
them, and they started after the alien lad.</p>

<p>But at the foot of the steps somebody
blocked the way. Louise Carey had flung
herself between.</p>

<p>"It's not fair, and you <i>shan't</i>!" she cried.</p>

<p>The astonished mob wavered in indecision.</p>

<p>"'Not <i>fair</i>?'" echoed Luke with a jeer.</p>

<p>"No," stormed Louise. "We didn't <i>ask</i>
him to come under the flag, and you shan't
<i>make</i> him do it!"</p>

<p>"We'll see about that&mdash;" began Luke.</p>

<p>"<i>That we will!</i>" put in Jimmie Fisher, but
it was not to Louise that he spoke. He was
talking to Luke, and he planted himself protectingly
in front of Louise and the little
German, and faced the third-grade bully.
Never before in her life had Louise realized
how beautiful was a shock of bristling red hair.</p>

<p>The third-grade bully was growling now,
but in a decidedly lower key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
  "Now, then"&mdash;Jimmie was speaking to
Louise this time&mdash;"you are bossing this game.
Say what you want done with that&mdash;that&mdash;"
and he looked at the frightened Rudolph.</p>

<p>Louise glanced up at the flag. It was floating
now&mdash;broad and free enough to cover all
who might come.</p>

<p>"I am going to <i>invite</i> Rudolph to come
under our flag," she said.</p>

<p>The children gasped as Louise held out
her hand to the little alien.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and be American with
us?" she asked kindly.</p>

<p>The boy drew back a moment while his blue
eyes searched her face for whatever hidden
cruelty might lurk beneath its seeming sweetness.
Then he smiled&mdash;a timid, but trusting
smile&mdash;and rising, took her extended hand.</p>

<p>But Billy Hastings called jeeringly: "He's
a sneak! He's just doing it to pretend!"</p>

<p>"He knows I'd drag him if he didn't come!"
exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"Coward! <i>Coward!</i>" yelled Luke. "You're
afraid to refuse!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
    And then, all suddenly, something in the
German lad flamed up. He snatched his
hand from Louise's. He stood to his full
height with blazing eyes, and cried:</p>

<p>"It's a lie!"</p>

<p>The sound of the school-bell broke the
startled quiet which followed the alien's spirited
revolt.</p>

<p>"<i>Please</i>," pleaded Louise, "don't mind
them! You've time yet to come under the
flag."</p>

<p>But Rudolph stood indignant, immovable.</p>

<p>"Get to your lines, children," and the
principal's call-bell was heard tapping above
on the porch.</p>

<p>A group of boys came suddenly together
into a tight bunch.</p>

<p>"We'll fix him after school," Louise heard
them threaten. And she knew that Rudolph
heard it, too&mdash;knew by the sudden whiteness
which swept over his face.</p>

<p>The next minute the boys and girls were
drawn up in parallel lines ready to march into
the schoolhouse. Louise was at the end of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
line and Rudolph Kreisler was the last on the
boys' row. They were opposite each other.</p>

<p>"Eyes front&mdash;march!" came the command,
and the lines moved forward with one impulse.</p>

<p>"Eyes front!" But to save her life Louise
could not help stealing a sidelong glance at
Rudolph.</p>

<p>To her horror she saw the little alien slip
quietly behind a rose-bush and drop out of
sight into the bricked-up area which furnished
window-space for the basement.</p>

<p>With a flash Louise remembered that those
windows communicated directly with the engine-room,
and that the engine-room was
directly under the third grade.</p>

<p>"Pay attention, Louise," came from the
porch, and Louise's startled, dark eyes were
turned to the front again.</p>

<p>When the children were seated in their
room it developed that Miss Barclay had
been temporarily called away, and that a
scared-looking girl from the teacher training-class
was in charge of the third grade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
    The new teacher did not miss Rudolph,
but the children did, and there was smothered
excitement in consequence.</p>

<p>Louise, who had not breathed a word of
what she knew, sat grasping her desk with
both hands. Rudolph Kreisler had refused
to come under the flag! Of course they had
taunted him, but the stark fact remained
that he <i>had</i> refused. And then no human
being had ever seen inside those bulging pockets.
Rudolph Kreisler, bulging pockets and
all, was in the engine-room, right under their
feet!</p>

<p>And then a new fear suddenly laid its grip
upon her heart. Suppose that German boy
should do something to the flag! She tried
to shift her position so that she could see out
of the window, but found it impossible.</p>

<p>"Oh-o-o, teacher!" Louise jumped at the
sound of excitement in the voice from behind
her, but quieted somewhat when she realized
that it was Tinsie Willis who spoke. "Louise
has left her hat on the front lawn!"</p>

<p>"Louise, go and get your hat," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
substitute, looking all about the room to see
which one of the many little girls might be
the one reported.</p>

<p>Louise rose from her seat with fear and
trembling and left the room.</p>

<p>But the first glimpse of the out-of-doors
dispelled her great new fear&mdash;her flag was
still there!</p>

<p>The stately lawn looked vast and awe-inspiring
now that one had to face its darkly
waving greens all alone, but Duty called.
She had left her hat by the flagpole, and she
now went timidly up to get it. She mounted
the green knoll. She looked up.</p>

<p>To play fair&mdash;to play fair! And yet, one
must be loyal. One couldn't let German
spies go around with their pockets&mdash;Rudolph
Kreisler was in the engine-room right
now!</p>

<p>Louise's grandfather and his father's father
had died for their country&mdash;would they know,
'way up yonder in heaven, if she of their own
blood were to turn coward at the test?</p>

<p>It was too poignant a risk. Louise took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
hep young life in her hands. Down the green
knoll and around the rose-bush, and she
dropped into the brick area right by the window
which opened from the engine-room. It
was raised.</p>

<p>The little girl peeped in, with her heart
swelling till she thought she would smother.
There was black dust on the floor and black
soot on the walls. And there in the centre
rose the huge black demon engine. But no
crouching enemy was to be seen anywhere&mdash;he
was hiding, of course!</p>

<p>She slipped through the window, past the
great silent engine, and came face to face
with Rudolph Kreisler.</p>

<p>The die was cast now.</p>

<p>"Tell me," demanded Louise, choking with
excitement and fear, "are you a&mdash;a <i>German
spy</i>?"</p>

<p>"No," said the astonished boy, "<i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>are</i> you, then?" There was
no backing down now; she was going to have
it out with him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be&mdash;American," he said, his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
lips threatening to quiver. "I&mdash;I thought I
was." And he looked away.</p>

<p>One must know the truth when one's country
was at stake. Louise drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing with your
pockets full of bombs, then?" she forced
herself to bring out.</p>

<p>The little boy turned toward her again,
and began slowly to draw out the contents
of those suspicious pockets. A mitt, a top,
two balls, a kite-string, a chicken-foot, a gopher,
nails of various lengths, some tobacco
tags, and a grimy stick of candy were laid
one by one on the janitor's tool-bench, and
the German spy stood with his pockets turned
wrong side out.</p>

<p>But one must have the <i>whole</i> truth.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with balls and mitts
when you sit on the steps all the time?" the
little girl demanded, but with decidedly less
asperity this time.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe they'd&mdash;let me play,
sometime." Something rolled down his cheek
and splashed on the front of his jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
    "<i>Won't</i> they let you play?" choked Louise,
blinking hard to clear her suddenly clouded
vision.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, why doesn't your mamma come
and scold the teacher about it?" she demanded
in indignant sympathy.</p>

<p>"I haven't any mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh-o-o! Well, you have a papa, haven't
you? Why doesn't <i>he</i> do something?"</p>

<p>"Father says those who are born here
don't know how awful it is to have to choose&mdash;&mdash;"
then he stopped.</p>

<p>"Doesn't your father hate Germany?"
the little girl asked.</p>

<p>"Why, no," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Does he love America?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" exclaimed the little girl.
Then&mdash;"Do you know, Rudolph, I'm sorry
for your papa!"</p>

<p>But Rudolph did not answer this time.
He merely turned aside till his face was hidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
    Suddenly a remembered something gripped
Louise.</p>

<p>"Rudolph," she said, "if you <i>are</i> American,
why did you refuse to come under the flag?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was going to&mdash;but they called me a
'coward,' and said I was afraid to refuse," he
answered huskily.</p>

<p>Louise found herself batting very heavy
lashes again.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I came to you," she said,
"because I never would have known that you
are not a German spy if you hadn't told me!"</p>

<p>"Lou-i-i-se!"</p>

<p>The two started at the call&mdash;it was in Tinsie
Willis's high-pitched voice. Evidently she
had been sent to find the truant.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" exclaimed Louise to Rudolph.
"They are after me for staying out so long.
I must go."</p>

<p>"Those steps yonder lead to the front
hall," said the boy. "Go up that way."</p>

<p>"But you must come, too!" Louise exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I can't," replied the miserable child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"The boys are fixing to fight me. When
school is over I'll slip out and go home."</p>

<p>"But why wait? Why don't you go
now?" asked the little girl, a strange uneasiness
coming over her.</p>

<p>"The police will get me if I go out on the
street during school hours," answered he.</p>

<p>"Lou-i-i-se!"</p>

<p>"I'm going," whispered Louise to Rudolph,
"but <i>don't</i> let the boys catch you! Miss
Barclay has gone&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>don't</i> let them
catch you, Rudolph!"</p>

<p>The next moment she glided up the dark
stairway and came out into the big hall.</p>

<p>Jimmie Fisher was emerging from the third-grade
cloaking-room with his hat and books.</p>

<p>"Father's leaving for France with a hospital
unit," he explained hurriedly, "and
mother sent for me to tell him good-by."
Then he darted away.</p>

<p>Miss Barclay gone! And Jimmie gone!
Had God himself deserted the third grade?</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>When Louise crept back into the schoolroom&mdash;ahead
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of Tinsie Willis, who was still
searching for her&mdash;she found things very
troublous indeed. The children were naughty
and restless, and the substitute was&mdash;a substitute!
The whole class had been told to
stay in, and Louise was promptly included in
the sentence as soon as her tardy little face
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>But she did not cry or fling herself about,
for she knew she had remained out of the
room overtime. Of course it had been for a
high purpose, but that she could not explain,
so she merely assented courteously and slipped
into her seat. Her grandfather and his
father's father had laid down their lives for
the right&mdash;if she did not succeed in living
through that dreadful half-hour of punishment,
she would be but another of her race
to die for a high cause.</p>

<p>Matters grew worse, and now the wind and
the sky took a hand. The great trees outside
began to battle fiercely together, and
the sky frowned, darker and darker.</p>

<p>Suddenly Louise&mdash;looking out of the window&mdash;saw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Perkins, the janitor, hauling down
the flag! Was the Houston Street School
surrendering to the Germans?</p>

<p>For one unworthy moment Louise suspected
Rudolph Kreisler again. But she instantly
afterward reminded herself that he
had told her with his own lips he wished to
be American.</p>

<p>Then the heavens opened and the floods
came. It was a terrible, terrible afternoon,
but children and substitute managed somehow
to live through it, and after so long a
time the gong sounded for the dismissal of
school.</p>

<p>The children of the other grades marched
out. Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;it sounded terribly like
a host in retreat!</p>

<p>Then quiet!&mdash;with the third-graders sitting
silent in their seats, trying to calculate how
many thousand years it would take for that
long clock-hand to move half-way round the
dial again.</p>

<p>Louise began wondering at just what point
Rudolph Kreisler would steal out of his hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and break for home. The rain had
stopped, and she hoped and believed that
the little German would make good his escape
before the third grade had finished serving
sentence.</p>

<p>Suddenly Luke, raising his hand, asked of
the substitute:</p>

<p>"May I speak to Billy Hastings on business?"</p>

<p>The substitute was writing something and
assented without looking up. Louise could
not help hearing the hoarsely whispered
"business."</p>

<p>"Connie Tipton," said Luke to Billy, "says
that that German spy has been hiding in the
basement but has slipped up-stairs&mdash;" The
hoarse whisper dropped lower at this point
and Louise could not catch the words which
followed. She guessed darkly, however, and
clung to her desk tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>At that fateful moment the substitute
looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Children, the others have all gone, and
it looks like rain again, so I am going to dismiss
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
you. File out quietly&mdash;I don't wish to
have to call you back."</p>

<p>She did not rise from her seat to marshal
them out, taking care that the last one of
them was out of sight of the schoolhouse
before he slackened his pace. She merely
dropped her eyes to her writing again and
left them practically to their own devices.</p>

<p>The boys marched through the cloaking-room
first, and they were ominously quiet
about it.</p>

<p>Then the little girls rose and filed out.
Louise led the girls' line, but though she followed
swiftly in the wake of the boys, they
had disappeared off the face of the earth
when she reached the cloaking-room door
which opened into the hall.</p>

<p>They had slipped off to hunt for Rudolph
Kreisler, and Louise knew it. She hoped
that Rudolph had left the building, but she
was not sure.</p>

<p>Something must be done&mdash;but <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>Just then she caught from above the sound
of tiptoeing and whispering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
    It was dishonorable to "tattle," but it
wasn't dishonorable to fly after a set of lawless
boys and keep them from abusing an innocent
would-be American. Louise deserted
the head of her line and darted up the long
stairs.</p>

<p>It was like a frightful nightmare&mdash;the
stealthy, breathless chase which followed.
She could not stop the boys in their mad
search, could not command their attention a
moment to explain. In and out they darted&mdash;fourth-grade,
fifth-grade, sixth-grade, seventh!
Every crack and cranny, every cloaking-room
and teacher's desk was made to
prove its innocence of sheltering the fugitive
spy. The scampering boys were just finishing
their search of the seventh grade when
Louise found herself at the foot of the garret
steps.</p>

<p>She stopped and surveyed their boxed-up
secretiveness. What if Rudolph had gone
up there?</p>

<p>From the sounds of disappointment now
issuing from the seventh grade she knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the last schoolroom to be searched had not
yielded up the quarry. Yes, Rudolph must
be in the garret, and of course the boys would
pursue him there!</p>

<p>Then a sudden idea came to her. If she
could but reach Rudolph first she might help
him to climb out of the garret window.</p>

<p>Up the dark steps she flew, but, alas! there
were flying feet to follow! The others had
seen, and were coming after.</p>

<p>They caught up with her before she reached
the top, and she and they burst into the long
garret room together.</p>

<p>It was big with mystery&mdash;that long garret
place&mdash;and weirdly frightening with its half-lights
and whole shadows. For one moment
the children stood at pause before its awesome
silence.</p>

<p>No German spy was in sight.</p>

<p>Then the boys began searching hurriedly,
and after a quick glance about the open and
lighter space before them, went pushing their
quest farther and farther into the distant
dark of the wings and gables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    Louise stood where they had left her, with
the feeling that <i>the end of all things</i> was at
hand, and that there was no use to struggle
further. Presently her mist-dimmed eyes
were attracted to a pile of something over at
a small window near where she stood. The
janitor had thrown their beautiful flag across
an old couch without taking the trouble to
roll it properly.</p>

<p>The indignant little girl started toward the
couch to straighten out and roll the flag
when her ear caught a sound which caused
her to pause a moment in dim speculation.
There was a step below, a firm, a familiar
step&mdash;but no, she must be mistaken!</p>

<p>She slipped over to the couch, but the next
moment drew back and clapped her hand
over her mouth to repress a startled scream.
A little yellow-haired boy lay asleep upon the
couch, with the big flag nearly covering him!</p>

<p>Louise leaned over him. Two shining drops
still lay on his cheek. He had sobbed himself
to sleep&mdash;he was such a <i>little</i> boy!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p0086a-illus.jpg" id="p0086a-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0086a-illus.jpg" width="500" height="703" alt="Covered by the flag" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">"You can't touch Rudolph!" she tried. "He's under the flag!"</p>
</div>

<p>A drift of damp air floated in from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
window, and the sleeper shivered and moved
as if to cuddle further under his shelter.
Louise very gently drew the bunting folds
closer about his neck. Somehow she <i>knew</i>
that this was not desecration.</p>

<p>That steady step from below again and&mdash;nearer!</p>

<p>But just at that moment the boys came
noisily back from the distant wings and
gables.</p>

<p>"Hello, Louise! What are you doing
there?" Luke Musgrove called.</p>

<p>Louise started up. She was between them
and the sleeping boy, but she could not screen
him from their astonished eyes.</p>

<p>"Gee, but there he is!" exclaimed Billy.
"Let's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the spirit of a long line of just and fair
Americans was facing them. Louise Carey
was descended from ancestors who had bought
freedom and fair play with their blood, so in
that hour&mdash;when she faced the unthinking
lawless&mdash;there was a something in her eyes
which brought them to a stand before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
    "You can't touch Rudolph!" she cried.
"He's under the flag!"</p>

<p>A quiet fell upon them. They looked first
at the sacred, sheltering flag of their country,
and then at each other. And while they yet
paused in awe there came to them the sound
of a steady, familiar step on the garret stair.
The next moment the door opened and there
entered Miss Barclay&mdash;the teacher who, by
her wisdom and her justice, could always command
to stillness the tempests of their childish
hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h2>AMERICA FIRST</h2>

<p>Little Riego Yañez was a native of
Mexico&mdash;of that unhappy part of Mexico
which is constantly plundered by revolutionary
bands who spend their time in fighting,
and who win their supplies by robbing the
more stable people of the republic.</p>

<p>Riego's father, Antonio Yañez, had suffered
many times at the hands of the revolutionists.
He was a saddler by trade, and also a small
farmer, so the products of his industry were
just what the warring bandits needed. But
the warring bandits did not pay for what they
needed. They merely took, and rode away!</p>

<p>So Antonio decided on a desperate step&mdash;he
would emigrate to America.</p>

<p>But Riego's mother objected to removing
to America. Mexico was rife with hatred
and distrust of the "gringos," and many and
dark were the stories told of the country north
of the Great North River. Besides, Riego's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
elder brother, Pascual, an unruly lad of fifteen,
was very bitterly opposed to the change.</p>

<p>So it was at length decided that Antonio
should dare alone the dangers and hardships
of America. If all was as the revolutionists
said, he could escape back to Chihuahua. If,
by happy chance, he should prosper in the
new country, he would send for wife and
children.</p>

<p>A year passed. The father's letters&mdash;few
and short, for he had had little schooling&mdash;were
chiefly concerned with begging them to
come and see for themselves.</p>

<p>Then, one never-to-be-forgotten day, the
mother and children packed into a hired
wagon the tragic little which the bandits had
left them, and set their faces toward the Rio
Grande. They, too, were bound for that distrusted
country which lay north of the northern
edge of their world. The mother and the
two girls were hopeful, but Pascual was silent
and Riego afraid.</p>

<p>Not till the night came down did they reach
the dark river which was to flow forever between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the old life and the new. To little
ten-year-old Riego this all-pervading darkness
meant "America," for to his drowsy
brain and anxious heart the black clouds
above and the darkly rolling waters below
seemed to typify the spirit of the land into
which he was crossing.</p>

<p>Another moment, however, and he had
given up the struggle to think it all out and
fallen asleep with his head on his mother's
lap.</p>

<p>The next morning Riego waked up in a
better land.</p>

<p>He sat up on his cot and blinked his black
eyes and stared about him at the cosey little
room. A flood of light poured in at the one
tiny window&mdash;Then the sun <i>did</i> shine in
this land of the gringos!</p>

<p>This was very interesting. Riego hurried
into his clothes and started out to see America.</p>

<p>His route of exploration led through a
cheery kitchen, where he found his two sisters
busy cooking breakfast, and smiling and
chatting at their work. But Riego had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
time to stop and question, for the green
things in the little garden beyond were beckoning
to him.</p>

<p>In another minute he was out among them.
It was very green&mdash;this "America"&mdash;very
green and very sunny, with rows upon rows
of the most wonderful vegetables running out
to meet the morning sun!</p>

<p>Soon Riego glimpsed his father and mother
beyond a dividing fence at the side, and he
ran at once to his father's arms. After the
first long embrace Riego drew back, the better
to see the father who had dared America
alone for his children's sake.</p>

<p>Why&mdash;his brow was smoother than Riego
remembered!&mdash;his eyes clearer!&mdash;Did one
grow younger, happier, in America?</p>

<p>And now Riego's mother was calling his
attention to the snow-white chickens which
fluttered about them. There was a cow, too,
Riego learned&mdash;a cow and a pony and pigs
and pigeons&mdash;and <i>all theirs</i>!</p>

<p>Riego shouted for joy. But the next moment
the joy died upon his lips, and he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
    "The revolutionists, father? How long
will they let us have these?"</p>

<p>"Riego," said his father, "there are no
revolutionists in America. Here, if a man
works, he receives a just reward, and he is
allowed to keep in peace what he earns. Our
only danger is from across the border."</p>

<p>Then Riego's mother told him that his
father had a fine saddle-shop which the
Americans never raided.</p>

<p>It was all very, very wonderful!&mdash;A man
was paid well for working, and could keep in
peace what he earned!&mdash;Was this what was
meant by "<i>America</i>"?</p>

<p>Riego's father's saddle-shop was the front
room of their little dwelling, and opened immediately
upon a small street in the Mexican
quarter of the village. It was a very interesting
place, indeed, for the wide door and
the hospitable bench just inside invited in
many an entertaining visitor, besides the
men who came to buy saddles or to have
their harness repaired.</p>

<p>One of these visitors, Alonzo Lorente, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
particularly interesting to Riego and his
brother, though their father always became
moodily quiet when the man came. Lorente
was a big, dashing fellow, full of strange oaths
and of dark insinuations. And somehow,
whenever he entered, the air of the shop
became electric with an indefinable excitement.</p>

<p>It did not take Riego long to see that, at
such times, his father managed to keep him
and Pascual so busy that they missed most
of their hero's inspiriting talk. Riego was
particularly unfortunate in this respect. He
spent little of his time in the shop where his
father and Pascual plied the saddler's trade,
for it was his duty to help in the market-garden.</p>

<p>This deprivation of Lorente's society, however,
had its compensations. It was Riego's
especial work to peddle their vegetables at
the khaki tents of the gringo soldiers a few
miles away, and this was very entertaining
and exciting in itself, for the soldiers were
jolly and kind and said nice things to one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
    And then, one rainy Saturday afternoon,
when the peddling was all done, Riego sat in
his father's shop and listened to Alonzo Lorente.
And Alonzo Lorente startled him
awake with the news that all was not well
with the land of America. He spoke darkly
of "gringos" and of "vengeance."</p>

<p>Pascual, Riego noticed, crept closer and
closer to the big man, till his fingers forgot
the leather they should have been stretching.</p>

<p>It was then that the unexpected happened.
The father, usually so quiet and so busy, suddenly
rose from his work-bench and came forward.</p>

<p>"Lorente," he said, and Pascual and Riego
started at the iron in his tone, "Lorente, it is
not the busy men who have quarrel with
America. It is those who have time to do&mdash;much
talking!"</p>

<p>There was a pause and dead silence, and
then Lorente the magnificent turned on his
heel with a growl and left the shop.</p>

<p>Then Antonio returned to his work-bench,
with Riego following, but Pascual stole to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
door and gazed at the receding Lorente till his
father called him sharply to his duties.</p>

<p>One day the father did not open his shop
at all. It was closed in honor of the great
American festival, Riego heard him explain
grimly to a follower of Lorente, who questioned.
And Riego heard the follower of
Lorente laugh scornfully as he strode away.</p>

<p>There being no work that day, Pascual and
Riego set out together to explore the yet
farther reaches of America.</p>

<p>But they had not gone far past the square
where loomed the several American stores
when they sighted a crowd in a grove of big
trees, and heard voices shouting and hands
clapping as if in great joy. A number of
gringo soldiers were roving about. Two were
coming leisurely toward them across the
green.</p>

<p>Riego wanted to press forward to see and
hear, but his brother jerked him by the
sleeve, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"It is the Americans' great feast-day, the
Fourth of July. Come away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
    "But father says <i>we</i> are Americans now.
Why can't we go and hear what they are
saying?" Riego's voice had risen in his
eagerness.</p>

<p>The approaching soldiers stopped and
looked at him, and Riego's heart stopped, too.</p>

<p>But the taller of the soldiers saluted him
in fine fashion, and addressed to him words
of courteous welcome:</p>

<p>"Don Pedro de Alvarado-Rain-in-the-Face-Sitting-Bull,
for such as thou art is the picnic!
Welcome to our city!"</p>

<p>Riego understood the gesture of invitation.
He thanked the courtly soldier, and walked
proudly forward, followed by his brother.</p>

<p>It was a gay scene, but quiet now, for someone
was speaking. The starry banner of
America fluttered everywhere, and smiling,
white-faced señoritas and brown-clad soldiers
were gathered here and there in listening
groups. Under a tree, near the platform, sat
musicians with shining silver horns and a big
drum. A number of children were seated on
the grass in front of the stand. Among them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Riego noticed, were many dark faces like his
own.</p>

<p>Suddenly Riego's courage gave way and he
started to retreat. But a sweet-faced señora
took him by the hand and led him and Pascual
to a place where they could see everything,
whispering as they went:</p>

<p>"It is our day of freedom."</p>

<p>At first the boy was dazed by the strangeness
of the scene, and his interest shifted.
But the sound of a sweet, ringing voice soon
compelled his attention and he turned quickly
toward the platform.</p>

<p>Riego caught his breath. Who was it?
<i>What</i> was it that was speaking to him?</p>

<p>In the centre of the platform stood a clear-eyed,
white-faced goddess, with the flag of
the new country draped around her slender
form, and the sunlight of this day of freedom
beating down upon her shining head. She
was speaking, but in the difficult new tongue.</p>

<p>Riego could not take his eyes away, but he
reached out his hand quickly to touch Pascual.</p>

<p>The sweet-faced señora leaned over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
    "America," she whispered in explanation.</p>

<p><i>America!</i> Beautiful America! Riego crept
forward, unconscious now of the crowd
around. Oh, to <i>understand</i> America!</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. The beautiful
goddess suddenly ceased speaking, and
her face became clouded with thought. Her
eyes were focussed on the eager boy who had
crept forward and was standing spellbound
before her&mdash;the most conspicuous of the
group of dark-faced, bewildered children.</p>

<p>Riego did not know that everybody in that
audience had suddenly leaned forward in dead
silence.</p>

<p>After one tense moment the Beautiful One
advanced to the edge of the platform and descended
the steps till she stood almost among
them.</p>

<p>And now this strange, new, better country
was speaking to Riego <i>in his own tongue</i>!</p>

<p>"You didn't <i>understand</i> me, did you?" she
asked in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Not <i>then</i>, my lady!&mdash;but <i>now</i>!" It was
Riego who answered her, but the other dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
faces were alight like his own now. The
crowd was leaning forward again.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is all the trouble!" said the
Beautiful One. "Our new people simply do
not understand America! Do you wish me
to tell you the story in Spanish?"</p>

<p>There were many who answered this time.</p>

<p>Then she told them in their own tongue of
the great struggle for a new freedom and a
new peace which had been waged upon this
soil over a hundred years before. And the
breathless children heard how this new ideal
of freedom had passed all bounds of the
country in which it was born, and thrilled all
lands. They heard how the noble La Fayette
of France, Steuben of Prussia, and Kosciuszko
of Poland each had offered his all
that America might be forever a refuge for
the oppressed. They learned how the German
De Kalb had laid down his life at Camden
for the new faith, and how Count Pulaski
had poured out the last drop of his Polish
blood to make the world's great dream of
freedom "come true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
    Then the Beautiful One told the children
how, throughout the more than one hundred
years since the fight was won, the footsore
and oppressed of many lands have found in
America work and a just reward for working,
the freedom to do anything which does not
harm another, and the great gift of peace!</p>

<p>"And now," exclaimed the speaker, "which
of you will promise with me to be loyal to
America? Stand up!"</p>

<p>And they stood up&mdash;the dark children, the
white-faced señoritas, the gringo soldiers, and
all!&mdash;and repeated after the Beautiful One:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Riego turned from the inspiring scene
it was to see his brother Pascual walking
away, and in close conversation with Alonzo
Lorente.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The days passed, but Riego still treasured
in his heart his first vision of America. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
knew now that the Beautiful One was only
a charming señorita and daughter of the big
captain who commanded at the American
camp. But he liked to think of her as
"America"&mdash;the beneficent goddess who had
smoothed the furrows from his father's brow
and crowned his faithful labors with reward.</p>

<p>And then, one momentous day, the Beautiful
One stood in the shop-door, asking in Spanish
if she might be allowed to enter. She was all
in white this time&mdash;snow-white. To Riego's
fond imagination she was still a shining goddess.</p>

<p>Riego's father welcomed the señorita and
dusted the bench that she might sit and rest,
for Riego had told him of the great American
festival, and Antonio had learned much besides.</p>

<p>The señorita had come to speak to the
father about his sons&mdash;and her smiling glance
included both the sullen Pascual and Riego,
who stood worshipfully by.</p>

<p>It seemed that the señorita&mdash;Miss Flora
Arden was her name&mdash;was to teach a class of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
"newly made Americans," and again her
glance included the boys. She wanted to
teach them to speak the English language
and to help them to a better understanding
of America. The señorita believed that most
of the trouble which the newly made Americans
encountered was due to the fact that
they did not know how to find and use the
good gifts which their new country had to
offer. And she was certain that most of the
trouble they <i>gave</i> was because they brought
old prejudices with them, and so did not open
their hearts to America.</p>

<p>Riego understood the spirit of her proposal
better than he did the words of her correct
Spanish. His father listened throughout with
thoughtful, grave attention.</p>

<p>There were no charges to be made for this
teaching? Then what was the señorita to
gain for so much effort?</p>

<p>"I?" said the señorita&mdash;she was standing
now, ready to depart&mdash;"I gain a better country!
My father is a soldier and serves his
country by helping to keep the peace along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
this troubled border. If I had been a son I
might have done as much. But I am only a
daughter, Antonio! And yet"&mdash;and she put
her arm over Riego's shoulders as she spoke&mdash;"if
I help to make loyal even <i>one</i> of America's
adopted sons, am not I, too, serving my
country?"</p>

<p>The father's rare smile assented to her
offer, even before his lips made the promise.</p>

<p>Riego followed the Beautiful One to the
door.</p>

<p>Outside, Alonzo Lorente slouched against a
lamp-post. The señorita looked into Lorente's
face and recoiled slightly. Riego saw
the recoil, and an unnamed fear suddenly laid
its hand upon his heart.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>Pascual and Riego went to Miss Arden's
class&mdash;Pascual sullen and uninterested, Riego
breathlessly eager. But they had not attended
many times&mdash;indeed, had just begun
to glimpse something of the bigness and goodness
of their new country&mdash;when the stroke
fell that was to change their little world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
The good father dropped at his work-bench,
speechless and bewildered. The American doctor
said he would be able to work again, but
that his mind would never be quite the same.</p>

<p>Their wise father thus reduced to childishness,
and their mother ignorant of the new
conditions and the new tongue, the boys were
left to plan for themselves.</p>

<p>Pascual left Miss Arden's class. He explained
that he would now have to take
charge of his father's shop; but he found time
to make many trips across the dark Rio
Grande and to talk much with Lorente, who
now resumed his old practice of dropping in
at the shop to chat. His younger brother,
however, continued under the señorita's instruction.</p>

<p>Riego learned at Miss Arden's class that
"freedom" gives one the right to do as he
wishes only in so far as he does not wish to
interfere with the rights of another.</p>

<p>"There is no 'freedom' except in loyal obedience
to law," she told him one day. "America
is a 'free' country because&mdash;though here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
are gathered people from all lands&mdash;they join
together in making laws which are kind and
impartial to all, and they stand together in
support of the laws they make."</p>

<p>"But, señorita, Alonzo Lorente says&mdash;" began
the boy, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"What does Alonzo Lorente say?" the
señorita asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I promised not to tell," stammered the
child.</p>

<p>There was the blue truth of heaven in the
señorita's eyes as she looked into his own,
and answered: "Riego, it is more than dishonest
in Lorente to accept the blessings
which America affords him and not be true
to her. It is worse than traitorous in him
to help spoil the peace of the country which
is his refuge from oppression. If Alonzo Lorente
likes the old way better than the new,
he should go back to the old country. If he
honestly wishes to change what he finds here,
and thinks he can better things, he has one
man's just share in deciding, for he is a naturalized
citizen and can vote on any question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
But Alonzo Lorente <i>should speak out
openly or else keep silent</i>!"</p>

<p>Before Riego left that afternoon Miss Arden
had him repeat with her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But little Riego did not dream in how short
a time would his loyalty to his new country
be tested. One afternoon&mdash;his father was
still lying unconscious&mdash;Riego was tending
the shop alone, for Pascual had crossed the
Rio Grande in the early morning and had not
yet returned.</p>

<p>It was a dull, dull afternoon, for no patrons
came, and the visitors merely glanced in and
passed on. It was hot and still, so the sleepy
Riego decided to rest. He found a cool spot
behind a pile of boxes, and lay down and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>When Riego opened his eyes again it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with a start. There were voices&mdash;smothered
voices&mdash;some men were in the shop! Riego
lay still and listened.</p>

<p>"We will attack the gringo camp to-night&mdash;just
before dawn," a smothered voice was
saying. "Alva has three hundred men and
more. They can easily surprise and destroy
these eighty Americans, and so can seize their
horses and ammunition."</p>

<p>"But the patrol?" It was Pascual's voice
that whispered the question. Riego's heart
turned sick. He recognized the voice of Lorente
in the terrifying reply:</p>

<p>"Pacheco and a picked few will knife the
patrol at the ford, then Alva's men will cross,
and approach the camp up the ravine."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning?" Pascual's voice
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, just before dawn."</p>

<p>There were approaching steps on the street.</p>

<p>A customer entered. Riego heard Lorente
departing&mdash;heard the customer inquire the
price of a saddle, and go out.</p>

<p>It must be done <i>now</i>&mdash;now while Pascual
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
was alone, and he could speak to him! The
next moment Riego stood before his brother.</p>

<p>"I heard you!" he cried. "Pascual, they
<i>must not</i>!"</p>

<p>But Pascual laid a fierce hand upon his
breast and pinned him to the wall.</p>

<p>It was a terrible scene&mdash;that which followed&mdash;terrible
in the tense quiet of its enactment&mdash;terrible
in its outcome!</p>

<p>With Riego pinned against the wall where
he needs must listen, Pascual poured forth
such a torrent of abuse, of falsehood, against
the "gringos" that at length the old hate
blood leapt in the younger boy's veins and
went beating through his brain.</p>

<p>The gringos were their enemies&mdash;<i>enemies</i>!
The men who were coming down upon them
with the dawn were of their own blood, of
their native country! What if the invaders
<i>were</i> "revolutionists"? Were they not <i>Mexican</i>?
Talk of "loyalty"&mdash;one must be loyal
to <i>one's own</i>!</p>

<p>When Pascual loosed his grip upon the slight
form it was after he had stirred to the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
dregs all that was passionate, all that was
ignorant and prejudiced and violent, in the
boy's nature.</p>

<p>That afternoon Riego did not report at
Miss Arden's class, but long after class hour
he was obliged to pass her house on the mission
to deliver a mended harness to a farmer
living near the American camp.</p>

<p>Miss Arden and her mother, Riego knew,
were the only members of the big captain's
family. They lived in a large house in the
woods, half-way between the town and the
camp. He knew also that the big captain
stayed in camp.</p>

<p>As Riego emerged from the long stretch of
lonely woods which separated Miss Arden's
house from the town, and as he faced the
other long stretch of woods which lay between
him and the camp, the boy was struck
by the isolation of the señorita's home.</p>

<p>He reflected, however, that Alva's men
were to attack the gringo soldiers by way of
the ford, and that the ford lay to the right
yonder, far out of connection with the captain's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
house. He was glad&mdash;glad that Alva's
men would not come that way!</p>

<p>Suddenly he spied the señorita herself.
She was standing on the steps of her father's
home. Riego's heart bounded within him at
sight of her. He pulled down his hat and
hoped to pass unrecognized, but the sweet,
familiar voice called:</p>

<p>"Riego!"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>Then she ran down the steps to him, and
put her gentle hands upon him, turning him
to her against his will.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Riego?" she asked.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"You didn't come to class this afternoon."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, after a moment of
silence in which she looked searchingly into
his face, "because we had an interesting lesson
to-day. It was all about what one ought
to do in case one should be forced to <i>choose
between</i> the old land and the new."</p>

<p>The boy gave a swift, upward glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
her, then dropped his eyes to the ground
again. Miss Arden continued, and her voice
was very serious now:</p>

<p>"And we decided, Riego, that one ought to
think out carefully which country was really
the better, and be true to that, because there
is a higher duty than that to party or country,
and that is&mdash;to the principles of justice
and freedom."</p>

<p>Riego's head sank lower. The Beautiful
One took one of his brown hands into her
own.</p>

<p>"And we said"&mdash;was she looking into the
dark heart of him?&mdash;"that whichever way
one chose, one should choose <i>openly</i>. Now
this little brown hand could never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the little brown hand was snatched
away, and with a great sob the child fled into
the woods.</p>

<p>When at last that night Riego did fall
asleep he dreamed that his beautiful America
came to him with her white arms held out in
appeal, and that he slipped a dagger out of
his bosom and stabbed her to the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
    He started, awake, and sat up. It was black
dark.</p>

<p><i>Had Alva struck already? Or was there yet
time?</i></p>

<p>Ten feet away was Pascual's cot&mdash;he must
not wake Pascual! As still as death he
slipped out of his bed, pulled on his overalls
that he had hung near, and crept out into the
moonless night.</p>

<p>Riego could not think&mdash;it was all so desperate!
He could only respond to the heart
that was in him, and creep forward through
the dark. But his feet knew the road that
he took, though his brain was reeling. He
was going straight to the one who had wakened
the new loyalty in him&mdash;his beautiful
America!</p>

<p>"I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the
republic for which it stands," went surging
through him as he struggled on.</p>

<p>Riego was not grandly heroic; he was only
a frightened little boy, but determined now
to do his loyal best for the country that had
sheltered him from oppression. And so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
though the treacherous sands might seek to
drag him down, though the dark chaparral
yonder might hide&mdash;any fearsome thing!&mdash;Riego
went forward.</p>

<p>And now the house of the big captain
loomed black before him. Riego stole up
the front steps. He knew behind which of
the long, closed windows the señorita slept,
and he approached and tapped fearfully
upon it.</p>

<p>It was a frightened voice that called: "Who
is <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>Riego was not conscious how he answered,
but he knew that a wave of relief flowed over
him when the blind of the long window
opened and he was drawn into the dark room
by a pair of familiar hands.</p>

<p>The blind was closed after him and a light
was struck.</p>

<p>The señorita's eyes were disclosed big and
startled; her face was as white as the long
robe she wore.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> it, Riego?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"They are coming!" he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
    "Who?" she exclaimed, catching him by
the shoulders, "<i>Who?</i>"</p>

<p>"Alva," the boy answered, "and three
hundred with him. They are going to surprise&mdash;our
soldiers&mdash;and kill them while they
sleep!"</p>

<p>The señorita sprang to the telephone. She
pulled down the lever many, many times,
then she staggered back against the wall.</p>

<p>"They have cut the wires!" she cried.
"Riego, you and I must take the warning!"</p>

<p>"To the camp?" the boy cried in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's no one within a mile of here
that could take it but us!"</p>

<p>"But the Mexicans have spies over there,"
the boy moaned. "They will find us in the
dark with their knives!"</p>

<p>She had flung on a long cloak, and was
hurriedly fastening her shoes.</p>

<p>"Then you stay here and I'll go," she
said.</p>

<p>"<i>You?</i>" cried the startled child&mdash;then&mdash;"It
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is dark out there, my lady; I'll go with
you."</p>

<p>They extinguished the light and stole out
together to the stable, but the horses were
gone!</p>

<p>Desperate now, they started out afoot.</p>

<p>The treacherous sand again and the black
dark! But they crept along together. Then
suddenly the boy's courage gave way and he
clung to the cloaked figure, sobbing:</p>

<p>"Señorita! Señorita! I am <i>afraid</i>!"</p>

<p>The señorita was trembling, too, and her
voice broke as she whispered:</p>

<p>"You and I don't make very good heroes,
do we?"</p>

<p>They had come to a standstill and were
clinging together in the dark. Suddenly there
was a sound of something approaching&mdash;-the
velvet tread of an unshod pony in the sand!</p>

<p>The rider passed.</p>

<p>When they breathed again the señorita took
him strongly by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Riego," she whispered&mdash;and there was no
break in her voice now&mdash;"we must separate.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
One of us must go straight to the ford and
warn the patrol, the other to camp."</p>

<p>"But it is near the ford that Pacheco is
hiding," the boy replied.</p>

<p>"I'll go to the ford," she said simply.</p>

<p>"No, my lady, <i>I</i> go&mdash;you take the news to
camp." And before she could detain him
the boy turned at a sharp angle and plunged
into the deeper blackness of the chaparral.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>A long nightmare intervened between their
parting and the time when the half-dead boy
clung to the saddle of the patrol and whispered
to him:</p>

<p>"Keep to the open, señor; there are men
with knives in the chaparral! Help is coming!"</p>

<p>Then, somehow, everything was blotted
out for Riego.</p>

<p>When consciousness came again to the boy,
the cool air of the dawn was choked with
dust clouds till he could not see ten feet before
him and his ears were nearly bursting with
the thunder-beat of frantic hoofs. Dim horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
were rearing and plunging against the reddening
dawn. There were shouts and cries and
firing! Firing!</p>

<p>Who was losing? Who was <i>winning</i>?</p>

<p>Dear God, Alva's men were sweeping back
across the Rio Grande!</p>

<p>One little frightened boy had saved the
day for the country that had given him
refuge from oppression.</p>

<p>But what was that? A call for help?
<i>Whose voice was that?</i></p>

<p>Riego plunged into the thick of the dust
cloud toward the cry, and dropped by Pascual's
side. How could he have known that
his brother would ride that night with the
invaders!</p>

<p>But Pascual was striving to speak. Riego
leaned over him and caught the whisper:</p>

<p>"Lorente shot me down to get my horse
and escape!"</p>

<p>And now the gringos were circling round
the wounded one&mdash;they would beat out his
brains with their guns! But&mdash;but&mdash;why,
they were lifting him up, and <i>tenderly</i>! The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Americans were lifting up his wounded
brother!</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>Many and bewildering were the things
which happened to Riego in the next few
hours. First, he and the all-but-dead Pascual
were carried by the soldiers to the American
camp. Then his brother was taken away from
him and borne into a closed tent.</p>

<p>The soldiers gathered around Riego and
patted him on the shoulder. They gave him
many things&mdash;things to eat and coins and
pocket-knives and tobacco-tags, all the while
challenging him to smile&mdash;he whose captured
brother was yonder!</p>

<p>Later the big captain sent for him and took
him by the hand.</p>

<p>"Riego Yañez," he said, "I am proud to
shake hands with an American hero!"</p>

<p>At length a tall soldier came to Riego and
led him to the closed tent. But the tall
soldier did not enter; he merely pushed the
boy inside the tent and dropped the khaki
flap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
    Riego blinked his eyes. Somebody was
lying stretched out on a cot, and somebody
was fanning him&mdash;the Beautiful One and his
brother! Riego crept toward her suddenly
outstretched hands.</p>

<p>Then he leaned over Pascual. But Pascual's
eyes were closed and on his face was a
yellow pallor.</p>

<p>"The surgeon has taken out the ball,"
whispered the Beautiful One. "He will live,
with good nursing, and I am on the job."
She paused a moment, then asked, as she
looked into his face with concern: "Aren't
you happy, you tragic little soldier? Why
don't you smile at the good news?"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;" began the child&mdash;and a strange,
sick feeling swept over him&mdash;"how long before
he will be well enough to be stood against
a wall&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you poor child!"&mdash;and the big tears
sprang to the señorita's eyes&mdash;"your brother
will not be stood against a wall and shot for
treason&mdash;never&mdash;<i>never</i>! And he's not going
to be shut up in prison, either!"</p>

    <p class="caption2">"Riego Yañez," he said. "I am proud to shake hands with an
American hero!"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
    "But why, señorita? Why? The big captain
knows that he was with Alva's men."</p>

<p>"He is young&mdash;just a boy," and the señorita
laid a tender hand upon the head of the
wounded lad. "He is the son of good parents
and brother to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, you tragic little soldier,
can't you guess who it is has saved your
brother?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, señorita?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yourself</i>, Riego. Because you have been
heroically loyal they are to give your brother
another chance. We Americans, Riego"&mdash;and
her white hand closed upon his own to include
him with her&mdash;"we Americans are going
to nurse Pascual back to a better life and
teach him how to be free!"</p>

<p>The sick lad stirred on his cot.</p>

<p>When the Beautiful One leaned over him
in quick solicitude, he smiled.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
